I created 2 separate vpcs in my aws environment to stimulate a multi-vpc architecture. I configured vpc-a with the 10.10.0.0/16 and vpc-b with the 10.20.0.0/16. in each vpc, create one public and private subnet. then I established a vpc peering connection between the two vpcs and updated the route tables in each vpc to allow traffic to flow between them via the peering connection.
